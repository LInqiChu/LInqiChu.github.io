I'm a **biostatistics graduate student** at Columbia University specializing in **causal inference, experimental design, and machine learning applications**.

My work spans:<br>
**Statistical methodology**: A/B testing, causal discovery, Bayesian inference<br>
**Applied ML**: Time series forecasting, classification models, deep learning<br>
**Data infrastructure**: Pipeline automation, dashboard design, reproducible workflows

I'm particularly interested in applying rigorous statistical methods to healthcare and product analytics challenges.

**Looking ahead**: I'm excited about roles in experimentation, causal inference, or data science where I can combine statistical thinking with hands-on problem-solving!
